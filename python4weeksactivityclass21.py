'''Generators
concept between lagy loading and egar loading
Genetors is a concept in python which helps us to generate values on the fly
This is a way in python in which we achieve lazy loading so to say and in a more
intermediate or advanced manner these some have endup writing parallel code as well.
corotines ==it is the programmer that the who giveaway the control of the given function in
the case of corotines
so thats what generators are..'''
